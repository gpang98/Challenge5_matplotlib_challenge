AnalysisÂ¶
Two CSV files were read and later merged to made up the final dataset. After cleaning for duplication, the final merged data was used for further analysis. The python codes below were derived from lecture notes and ChatGPT.

From the study of 249 mice having squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors, the following observations are made with regards to response to treatment using a range of drug regimen.

Data:
-one of the mice data was dropped due to duplication.
-Capomulin and Ramicane were the used the most on the treatment of the mice.
-Almost equal proportion of gender split (51% Male vs 49% Female)

Results:
-The drug of interest, Capomulin is the 2nd best overall performing drug, losing to Ramicane by a small margin as measured in Tumor Volume (mean, median, variance, std. dev and Std. Err.).
-One of the mice sample (I509) showed clear decreased in Tumor Volume after 20 days of treatment with Capomulin
-Heavier mice tend to have larger average Tumor Volume.

Recommendation:
-Capomulin showed comparable result to the drug Ramicane in treating SCC and showed reduction in tumor size after 20 days of treatment. Hence, I would recommend proposing Capomulin as a viable candidate to treat SCC and propose further testing to confirm this study.
